# Conformance fixtures (POC — submodule wired, test deferred)

This pins [`sungwy/iceberg-testing`](https://github.com/sungwy/iceberg-testing) as a
git submodule at `iceberg-testing/`: language-neutral conformance fixtures for
Apache Iceberg, modeled on `apache/parquet-testing`. Three surfaces:

- `table-spec/types/` — type-string parse + exact re-serialize (canonical)
- `table-spec/transforms/bucket/` — the Appendix B 32-bit bucket hash, as a
  Known-Answer-Test, including byte-boundary decimals and a non-BMP string
- `table-spec/delete-formats/` — positional and equality delete-file decode by
  field-id

A C++ (`ctest`) harness that walks these fixtures is **not included in this POC**.
It was prepared in an environment without a C++ toolchain, so rather than commit an
unverified, possibly non-compiling test, the wiring is left as a TODO. The PyIceberg
fork has the worked example, including how a consumer keeps a local staged-adoption
list for cases it does not yet satisfy:
https://github.com/sungwy/iceberg-python/pull/1

To consume: `git submodule update --init`, then walk `iceberg-testing/table-spec/**`
and apply each surface README's assertion (parse + re-serialize; compute the bucket
hash and compare; decode delete-file columns by field-id).

The bucket Known-Answer-Test is the highest-signal surface to wire first: the
expected hashes are taken from the spec, and the byte-boundary decimal cases
(`-1.28`, `-327.68`) are where minimal two's-complement encoding has diverged.
